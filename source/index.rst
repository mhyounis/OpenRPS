    Open Radiation Physics Suite (OpenRPS) is a collection of projects that are focused on, at the moment, radiation transport. It currently consists of three major projects:

    :target: Lionbolt/Lionbolt.html

.. container:: vbarlb
    
    A program which can perform deterministic space-angle solves of the Boltzmann transport equation. Primarily written in Fortran.

.. container:: vbarnp
    
    A library which discretizes the physics of photons and electrons (at the moment exclusively under the multigroup approximation). Primarily written in Fortran.

.. container:: vbartd
    
    A Python module which provides tools to extract and post-process Lionbolt data.

More information on these projects is provided in their respective pages
