Younis Radiation Physics Suite
==============================

The Younis Radiation Physics Suite (YRPS) is a collection of codes that are focused on, at the moment, radiation transport. It consists of three major codes: 

:ref:`Lionbolt <lionbolt>`

.. container:: vbaryrps
    
    A Fortran program which can perform deterministic space-angle solves of the Boltzmann transport equation.

:ref:`NittanyPhysics <nittanyphysics>`

.. container:: vbaryrps
    
    A Fortran library which discretizes the physics of photons and electrons (at the moment exclusively) under the multigroup approximation.

:ref:`Terpdose <terpdose>`

.. container:: vbaryrps
    
    A Python module which can extract, process, and plot the .h5 files put out by Lionbolt.

More information on these codes is provided in their respective pages

I am always interested in discussing the codes included in YRPS. I can be reached at myounis@terpmail.umd.edu.
