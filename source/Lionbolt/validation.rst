Validation
==========

The validation of Lionbolt is basically taken concurrently with the validation of NittanyPhysics. Of course, during construction of Lionbolt, the method of manufactured solutions (MMS) was employed independently in order to demonstrate which failures of the code were due to space-angle code and which were due to physics code, however, this is foregone in this documentation as we can demonstrate full cooperation between the space-angle and physics parts of the code. To see the validation page in NittanyPhysics follow this link [REVISIT].
