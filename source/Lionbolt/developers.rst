Developer's Guide
=================

This page will eventually discuss several considerations for eventual developers, including high-level structure of Lionbolt, adding input headers/subheaders/keys, etc. It will also link to pages for every (public API and internal) file in Lionbolt source code, detailing the various subroutines and functions, with their inputs and outputs.

In the meantime if you have a particular interest in developing for Lionbolt, feel free to direct any questions to the author, at myounis@terpmail.umd.edu.
